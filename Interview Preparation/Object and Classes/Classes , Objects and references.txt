Class is a template or blue print used to create objects

Object is a instance of a class / actual implementation of a class

Example - Person is a class , using the person template we can create a object called 'Thivanka'
          a class has attributes and functionality and object can be used to add value to those
		  attributes and functionality.
		  
		  Shape is a class , using the shape clss we can create objects like square and rectanlges 
		  (actually they are subclasses but adding value to them would make them an object)
		  

Declaration -> Person person;

'person' is a memory reference/ reference variable showing where person is stored in memory

Process of creating a instance is called 'instantiation' 

instantiation ->  Person person = new Person()

'new' keyword followed by the constructor of that class -> Person() 
is used to allocate memory in heap ( creating a person in memory )
