Equality operator(==)

We can apply equality operators for every primitive type, including the boolean type. 
We can also apply equality operators for object types. 

If we apply == for object types then, 
there should be compatibility between 
arguments types (either child to parent or parent to child or same type). 
Otherwise, we will get a compile-time error. 

Example

Thread t = new Thread();
String s = new String("GEEKS");

// Uncomment to see error 
System.out.println(t==s);
// error: incomparable types: Thread and String


.equals() Method

the String equals() method compares the two given strings based on the data/content of the string. 
If all the contents of both the strings are the same, it returns true. 
If all characters are not matched, then it returns false.
